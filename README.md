### Acknowledgment of AI Use

This report was developed with the support of GenAI tools, specifically **ChatGPT (March 2025 version)**. These tools were used in accordance with TU/e's policy on AI in education, particularly for:

- Brainstorming and refining modeling strategies  
- Generating MATLAB code templates for model comparison and validation  
- Clarifying theoretical concepts such as residual analysis, model structures, and stability  
- Summarizing results and drafting explanatory text for report sections  

The use of AI was limited to **general functionalities** and did **not replace core academic work** such as experimental design, model estimation, or interpretation of results. All generated content was critically reviewed, adapted, and validated by the author to ensure compliance with academic standards and scientific integrity, as outlined in the **TU/e Code of Scientific Conduct**.
